# Chariot System Architecture

As of this page is writtem, **Chariot** is a cross-platform application that serves no purpose yet designed to offer a seamless user experience through a combination of modern technologies and robust backend services. Built with [**Nuxt 3**](https://nuxt.com) and [**Tauri**](https://tauri.app) on the frontend, and [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org) with the [**Axum**](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework on the backend. This documentation explores the various aspects of the system architecture in detail, including the fronted and backend layers, the API communication flow, the database schema, and security considerations.

Although these pages are available, Chariot is not an open-source project, and its source code is not publicly accessible. However, we offer detailed written explanations of how the system works. The language used throughout this documentation is intended to be as clear and understandable as possible. That said, if you're not a developer with an interest in computer science, this content may not be relevant to you.
