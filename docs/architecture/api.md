# API Communication

The frontend and backend communicate through a well-structured **RESTful API**. Each endpoint is clearly defined using conventional HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and returns consistent JSON responses. The API follows best practices in naming conventions and error handling to provide clarity and ease of integration.

Endpoints are secured using token validation middleware, and inputs are validated both on the frontend (for user feedback) and backend (for security). Common response formats include success messages, error descriptions, and data payloads, making it easy for the frontend to handle various scenarios.

In the Tauri version of the app, HTTP communication with the backend remains consistent, although there is also potential for direct function calls via custom Tauri commands for optimised interactions.
