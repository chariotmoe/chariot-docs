# Monitoring and Logging

To ensure observability and reliability, logging is implemented across both the frontend and backend. On the backend, the tracing crate is used for structured logging, helping developers debug and monitor runtime behavior. On the frontend, Nuxt provides hooks for global error handling, and integration with tools like Sentry is considered for real-time error tracking.

Future updates will include a central monitoring dashboard for error and performance metrics.
